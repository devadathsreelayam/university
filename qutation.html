                The University came into being as a result of the efforts of the leaders C.H. Mohammed Koya, C. Achutha Menon, and K. P. Kesava Menon. With the encouragement of the then Kerala Chief Minister, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, C.H. Mohammed Koya the then Kerala Education Minister constituted a twenty-two member committee of experts to make a pilot study on establishing new universities in the State.
            </p>
            <p>
                The twenty-two member Committee in its report unanimously recommended the immediate establishment of a University in Calicut to organize post-graduate departments of studies and research and to affiliate colleges in the northern districts. Before long C.H. Mohammed Koya appointed K.C. Chacko, Director of Technical Education as the special officer and M. Abdul Rahim, Municipal Commissioner, as administrative officer for the formation of the University at Calicut. On 23 July 1968 C.H Mohammed Koya obtained an Ordinance on creating the University.
